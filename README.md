# Welcome to Physical Chemistry I Lab!
Physical Chemistry I Laboratory is the companion class to Physical Chemistry I lecture. The focus will be on reinforcing key concepts from lecture in straightforward experimental procedures. 

By the end of this course, you will be able to:
* Maintain a professional notebook.
* Successfully navigate Python as a data visualization and analysis tool.
* Be fluent with methods for determining and propagating measurement uncertainty with proper confidence limits.
* Appreciate the power of straightforward scientific investigation to deduce atomic and molecular properties.
* Present a complete synthesis of the laboratory exercise in the form of formal reports.
